# ProgressBar

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/paul/progress_bar.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/paul/progress_bar)

*ProgressBar* is a simple Ruby library for displaying progress of
long-running tasks on the console. It is intended to be as simple to use
as possible.

**NOTE:** This project isn't dead! It's just feature complete, and I don't want
to keep adding things to it. If you find bugs, please open an Issue, or even
better, a Pull Request, and I'll take a look. We at ProgressBar know you have
lots of progress bar alternatives, and we thank you for using ProgressBar!


# Installation

    gem install progress_bar

# Examples

## The Easy Way


    require 'progress_bar'
    bar = ProgressBar.new

    100.times do
      sleep 0.1
      bar.increment!
    end

Produces output like:

    [#######################################                           ] [ 59.00%] [00:06]

*Note: It may not be exactly like this. I might have changed the default
meters between now and when I wrote this readme, and forgotten to update
it.*

## Setting the Max

Usually, the defaults should be fine, the only thing you'll need to
tweak is the max.

    bar = ProgressBar.new(1000)

## Larger Steps

If you want to process several things, and update less often, you can
pass a number to `#increment!`

    bar.increment! 42


## Picking the meters

By default, ProgressBar will use all available meters (this will
probably change). To select which meters you want, and in which order,
pass them to the constructor:

    bar = ProgressBar.new(100, :bar, :rate, :eta)


### Available Meters

 * `:bar` -- The bar itself, fills empty space with "#"s. Ex: `[###
   ]`.
 * `:counter` -- Number of items complete, over the max. Ex: `[ 20/100]`
 * `:percentage` -- Percentage of items in the maximum. Ex: `[ 42%]`
 * `:elapsed` -- Time elapsed (since the ProgressBar was initialized.
   Ex: `[00:42]`
 * `:eta` -- Estimated Time remaining. Given the rate that items are
   completed, a guess at how long the rest will take. Ex: `[01:30]`
 * `:rate` -- The rate at which items are being completed. Ex: `[
   42.42/s]`

Run the tests to see examples of all the formats, with different values
and maximums.
```
gem install --development progress_bar
rspec spec/*_spec.rb
